# Condition Number of the Quantum Algebraic Attack on chosen Cryptosystems

On the condition number of the Qantum Algebraic attack by Chen-Gao for chosen cryptosystems

## Objective

This repository documents the work in progress on the investigation of the condition number of the scientific paper

**Quantum Algorithms for Boolean Equation Solving and Quantum Algebraic Attack on Cryptosystems**

by Y.~-A.~Chen, X.~-S.~Gao, https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06239}, 2018.


## History

* In a first step, we looked at the condition number of the globally used symmetric Advanced Encryption Standard AES. 
* Based on the the condition number of AES we could easily derive the condition number of eAES.
