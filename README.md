*Fundamental Research as Open Source Project between Science and Industry*

Identifying Security Levels for chosen globally used cryptosystems wrt. the Quantum Algebraic Attack (QAA) by Chen-Gao.


## Objective

This repository documents the work in progress on the investigation of the condition number of the scientific paper
**Quantum Algorithms for Boolean Equation Solving and Quantum Algebraic Attack on Cryptosystems**
by Y.-A.Chen, X.-S.Gao, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06239.pdf, 2018.


## Project Description

* [Slides in German](https://github.com/XeniaGabriela/QAA_Condition_Nr/blob/master/QAA_condition_number_project_description_DE.pdf)


## Progress

* In a first phase, we looked at the cassical notion of a condition number of the QAA on the globally used symmetric Advanced Encryption Standard AES. Under these assumptions, the condition number of the QAA on AES equals infinity. 
* The second (current) phase is the investigation of the condition number of the Macaulay matrix while ignoring zero rows amd columns. This pahse consists of the explicit generation of the reduced Macaulay matrix of the polynomial system derived from the S-Box and the actual computation of its condition number.

### Facts about the QAA

* The QAA on cryptosystems is based on solving Boolean Multivariate Equation System (BMQ).


#### Facts about the QAA on AES

The key length and the number of rounds only have only minor impact on the complexity of the attack. (See N_k and N_r in Proposition 6.1 section 6.1 of the Cen-Gao paper)

The complexity of the key schedule function has no impact on the complexity of the QAA, because:

* The key and the expanded key are considered as key variables in the BMQ.
* The derived sub keys are considered as state variables in the BMQ.

This special property of the QAA offers a serious advantage over other cryptanalyses, such as Grover's Search algorithm. It also defines new criteria for post-quantum cryptography. A cryptosystem offering resilience against the QAA must satisfy at least one of he following criteria:

1) It cannot be reduced to a BMQ
2) If it can be reduced to a BMQ, its QAA Macaulay matrix must have a large condition nummer /kappa.


### Results for AES

* The condition number of the Macaulay matrix of the BMQ for AES equals the condition number of the Macaulay matrix derived from the AES S-Box.
* The classical condition number of the Macaulay matrix of the S-Box equals infinity


## Context Computeralgebra

Computeralgebra is the scientific area which concerns itself with non-numerical mathematical algorithms and their implementations.
Therefore it is the means which materializes mathematical theory into applicable algorithms and programs. 
Cryptography is just one of other many topics which is handled by Computeralgebra researchers.


### Computeralgebra Professionals Group Germany

The Computeralgebra Professionals Group Germany ([Fachgruppe Computeralgebra](https://fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de/fachgruppe/)) is a group of the GI ([Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Informatik](https://gi.de/)). 
Furthermore it is associated to the DMV ([Deutsche Mathematikervereinigung](https://www.mathematik.de/)).


### CAR Article Autumn 2020

We have published a summary of the identified impacts of the QAA in the magazine of the Computeralgebra Professionals Group Germany under the title *"Quantum Algebraic Attack"*. Our goal is to raise interest in Quantum Computing research in the Computeralgebra community as well as in the industry. The online version of it will be published in Spring 2021.

See our preprint: [CAR article (Computeralgebra Rundbrief October 2020)](computeralgebra/GameChangerComputerAlgebra.pdf).

## Interlude: Important Progress in Quantum Algorithm Design

Important Lecture by I. Chuang on "Grand Unification of Quantum Algorithms" with the goal of enabling the construction of new Quantum Algorithms ( 2020 ): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFRojXdrVXI&t=44s

The 3 main killer Q-algos, search, factoring and simulation, are all on the same structural footing: The quantum singular value transformation algorithm by Gilyen et al.: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01838.pdf

Remark: The QAA is not mentioned, but probably Chen-Gao built on this universal algorithm, too.

## SVD-Algorithm for starting experiments on SVD calculations ( Singular Value Decomposition )

Algorithm.SVD

Input: (m,n)-Matrix A
Output: SVD  A = U.S.V^T  ,
where U (m,m) consists of the left, and V (n,n) of the right singular vectors, and
S (m,n) is diagonal, S=diag(s1,...,sp) , the s_i are the singular values , p := min(m,n), r is the rank of A .

1. If m > n , calculate A^T.A , Else , calculate A.A^T .
2. Let m > n , calculate the eigenvalues la_i of the hermitian matrix A^T.A .
   The singular values s_i are the square roots( la_i ) .
   r is equal to the number of non-zero singular values.
3. Calculate an orthonormal Eigenbasis of A^T.A , ( v1,...,vn ) .
   The latter is equal to V = ( v1,...,vn ), the v_i are the columns of V .
4. As for U : FOR  i = 1 to r  DO
              u_i := (1/s_i) Av_i 
   
              FOR  i = r+1 to m  DO
              The columnvectors (u_r+1,...,u_m) of U are an orthonormal basis of Ker(A^T),
              which can be calculated by calling the Algorithm.BASIS-OF-KERNEL below.
